Original mod description тнг

## Enhanced Block Entities

EBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>
**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>
**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>
These may include:
- Smooth lighting on block entities
- Being able to remodel block entities with block models
- Toggling features like christmas chests
- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible
<br/><br/>

**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>

## FPS Boost
Rendering 1700 chests:

A 155% frame rate increase!

## Resource Packs
You can edit EBE's block entity models using resource packs, since they have been converted to conventional .json block models. <br/>
